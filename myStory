**The three little pigs
Once upon a time, in the center of a little village was a small cottage. Inside that cottage, lived a mother pig and her three sons. The mother loved her sons dearly as any mother
would. She fed them food, and payed for their clothes. But one day, she had realised that her baby piglets were not actually piglets anymore. Her three sons were taking up all 
the space in the house, as they became bigger and bigger, and harder to maintain. One day, the mother had enough. She gave each of her sons an allowance, and told them to go and 
spend it on things for a new home. The first pig went and bought straw from a farmer to build his house. He quickly built it and lived inside happily, until he saw a wolf outside.
When he did not let it in, the wolf blew his house down!
